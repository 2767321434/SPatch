    <string name="sp_info">SPatch is a software that enables native applications to load Xposed modules without ROOT or unlock. There are three operation modes of Tianjian: modified APK mode, modified-free mode and global mode. Simply click on the application + number and select the application installation package according to the prompt to use the module easily. It supports a variety of modules, including the Xposed module you made yourself. It also supports the integration of modules into the installation package (in the module list, click on the module information and use the module). At present, it can enable or close the global mode and no modification mode in the settings page. The application needs to be rebuilt after opening the modifier-free mode. It can be set up to send information to the notification bar after each application is built. It can also be set up to disable the whole module, intelligent shelling and anti-reinforcement functions (intelligent shelling, anti-reinforcement and non-modification construction applications need to download additional native library files). In addition, it can open debugging mode and disable security mode in the settings. To facilitate developers to analyze the work of the module. The reconstructed application will load all modules installed locally by default, and the integrated module will no longer rely on the module software installed locally, so that the installation package can be shared with others. Note that the modifier-free mode relies on the application of the almanac. If the application of the almanac is uninstalled, all application data of the modifier-free mode will be empty and unrecoverable. The global mode also relies on the application of the heavenly observer. When the global mode is enabled, if the application of the heavenly observer is uninstalled, all the modules of the heavenly observer will be invalid. This application is only for learning.
